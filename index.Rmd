# Prerequisites {-}
This is a manual for the R tools hosted at [our GitHub repository](https://github.com/cellular-tracking-technologies/data_tools). A RStudio tutorial is beyond the scope of this readme, but there are great resources to get you [started with installing R and RStudio](https://www.earthdatascience.org/courses/earth-analytics/document-your-science/setup-r-rstudio/).

## How to use GitHub {-}
1. Create an [account](https://github.com).
2. Work through chapters 6-12 [here](https://happygitwithr.com/install-git.html) if you need to install git, and connect it all with RStudio: 
3. Follow the instructions (at least through 5) [here](https://r-bio.github.io/intro-git-rstudio/) under "How to do this using RStudio and GitHub?"
  + you don't need to enter the backticks in the shell
  + this example is a bit misleading because it doesn't include the .git, copy the link to the clipboard like before
  + RESTART RSTUDIO BEFORE MOVING ONTO STEP 6 IN THIS TUTORIAL
4. If you want to pull updates from here to your copy, see [chapter 31](https://happygitwithr.com/upstream-changes.html#pull-changes-from-upstream).
