# AOS2024 - 'celltracktech' Workshop

This RMarkdown document goes over the files, functions, and analyses from the 2024 American Ornithological Society (AOS) Workshop in Estes Park, CO on the 'celltracktech' R package. This package was developed by Dr. Jessica Gorzo and Sean Burcher.

This document will serve as a tutorial on how Cellular Tracking Technologies (CTT) registered users can download their data from our server, and visualize the data using the built-in package functions.

This tutorial provides step-by-step instructions on how to obtain your data. This style is used for absolute beginners in R, SQL, and data science.
